# Description

Write a program that asks the user for:

- The number of kilometers to be traveled
- The age of the passenger

Based on this information, the program should calculate the total price of the travel ticket, according to the following rules:

- The ticket price is defined based on kilometers (0.21 â‚¬ per km)
- A 20% discount is applied for minors
- A 40% discount is applied for those over 65.

## MILESTONE 1:

Let's start by implementing the program without any aesthetics: using exclusively two inputs and a button (unstyled), we achieve the specifications written above. The final response (or output) will also be written in the console.

## MILESTONE 2:

Only once milestone 1 is complete and functional will we create a form on the page where the user can enter the data and view the final calculation with the price.
The data summary and the final price output will then be printed on the page (the price must be formatted with a maximum of two decimal places to indicate the cents on the price). This will require a bit of research.

## Bonus:

- Manage the kilometer field with an input of type number
- Manage the age field with a <select>
- Add a button to reset the form
- Add a field with the passenger's name
- Randomize a random carriage number on the ticket
- Randomize on the ticket a Passenger Code of 5 digits that must start with the number 9

## Note:

If you don't feel particularly creative, this might be an implementation to follow for the second milestone. You can choose to implement a completely different or similar solution, but in any case, try to make it your own.
